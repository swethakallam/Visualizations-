Dataset 

This is a dataset containing records from the new crime incident report system, which includes a reduced set of fields focused on capturing the type of incident as well as when and where it occurred. It has 2,60,760 rows and 17 columns.

The fields include- 
Incident_number
Offense_code
Offensecodegroup
Offense_description
District
Reporting_area
Shooting
Occurredondate
Year
Month
Dayofweek
Hour
Ucr_part
Street
Latitude
Longitude
Location

I choose this dataset as it relied mostly on data exploration and since data visualization is the main goal here. I could directly jump into it, without worrying about data cleaning of the transformation part.
